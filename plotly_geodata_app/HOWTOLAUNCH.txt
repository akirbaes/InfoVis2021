HOWTOLAUNCH

You will need conda and the libraries listed in group5_env.yml

Move a conda terminal to group5/plotly_geodata_app where group5_environment.yml is located

To create a separate environment:

	conda create -f group5_env.yml

Switch to your environment

	conda activate group5_env

This will launch the combined view:

	python main_app.py

This will launch the geodata view only:

	python geodata_app.py
